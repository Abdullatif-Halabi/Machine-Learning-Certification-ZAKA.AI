# Machine-Learning-Certification-ZAKA.AI

Welcome to the repository for the Machine Learning Engineer Certification Projects! Within this repository, you'll discover a series of pilot projects and the final capstone project completed as part of my journey towards becoming a certified Machine Learning Engineer. These projects are systematically arranged in week-by-week folders, each housing Google Colab notebooks or Python files showcasing the progress made during that specific week. Furthermore, all the datasets utilized in these projects are neatly stored in subfolders named 'data.'

Please bear in mind that this repository is a continual work in progress. I'm consistently adding files to ensure a comprehensive overview of the projects and the skill set honed throughout the certification program. Feel encouraged to navigate through the folders and files to gain deeper insights into the diverse machine learning topics covered throughout the course.

## Project Structure

Within this repository, the structure is organized as follows:

-Week X: Each week is delineated by its individual folder (e.g., Week 1, Week 2, etc.). Inside these folders, you'll discover project-specific materials, code, and comprehensive documentation.

=Data: This designated subfolder houses all the datasets utilized across the projects. Exploring this data can provide a deeper understanding of the context and challenges tackled in each project.
